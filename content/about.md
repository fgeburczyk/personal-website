## About Me

I'm a Data Professional specialising in credit risk model implementation, with expertise in SAS, SQL, ETL pipelines, and Azure DevOps. I bridge the gap between model development and deployment in Agile and Scrum environments, delivering scalable and compliant solutions.

With a legal background, I navigate complex regulatory frameworks such as the CRR and EBA Guidelines, ensuring data-driven models align with banking regulations.

Fluent in Polish, German, English, and French, I thrive in international teams and cross-border projects. Beyond SAS and GCP certifications, I am expanding my skill set with Python, while exploring how Generative AI can support code development.
