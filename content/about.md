## About Me

I'm a Senior Data Scientist specializing in the implementation of credit risk models at a systemically important bank. My day-to-day work revolves around building and maintaining ETL pipelines — and I genuinely enjoy debugging the messy ones.

My path here was unconventional. I trained as a lawyer and spent years in private practice at firms including PwC and Noerr LLP. I also served as an adjunct professor of law for nearly five years. That legal background still shapes how I think — I find myself digging into the Capital Requirements Regulation and other regulatory frameworks out of genuine curiosity about how they work.

More recently, I've been exploring BCBS 239 and data governance, an area that surprised me by how loosely regulated it remains — mostly soft law with limited binding force. The intersection of regulation and data is where I find the most interesting questions.

## What I Work With

- **SQL** — daily driver for data pipelines
- **SAS** — credit risk model implementation
- **Python** — analysis, automation, and exploration
- **LLMs** — a recent fascination I'm actively exploring
