## Overview

The **ECB Guide on Risk Data Aggregation and Risk Reporting (RDARR)**, published in May 2024, sets out minimum expectations for how significant institutions must govern their risk data, maintain their IT architecture, and ensure data quality to support sound risk management. It is the ECB's operationalisation of **BCBS 239** — the Basel Committee's foundational standard for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting.

This project maps the framework as a knowledge graph: 43 concepts and 55 relationships structured across the four core pillars of RDARR.

## What the Graph Covers

| Pillar | Key concepts |
|---|---|
| **Governance** | Management body responsibilities, designated accountability, collective suitability, three lines of defence, training |
| **Data Architecture** | Group-wide data architecture, data lineage, data taxonomy, end-to-end data quality controls |
| **Data Quality** | Data quality indicators, KPI monitoring, issue management, end-user computing, ICAAP/ILAAP integration |
| **Risk Reporting** | Reporting timeliness, frequency calibration, stress-ready capabilities, meaningful internal reporting |

## Why This Matters

RDARR compliance sits at the intersection of governance, technology, and data — making it unusually difficult to navigate in isolation. The graph makes the framework's internal logic visible: which governance structures enable which data controls, how data quality feeds into reporting obligations, and where management body accountability connects to operational delivery.

It is intended as a reference tool for practitioners working on RDARR implementation programmes or supervisory assessments.
